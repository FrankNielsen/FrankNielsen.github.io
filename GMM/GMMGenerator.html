<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">

The most famous statistical mixture consists of the family of Gaussian mixtures.<BR>
In the literature, they bear the names of
<UL>
<LI> GMMs: Gaussian mixture models, or
<LI> MoGs: Mixtures of Gaussians.
</UL>

The applet below generates random GMMs 
(<b>k</b> components in <b>d</b> dimension with separability factor <b>epsilon</b>) 
according to the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishart_distribution">Wishart distribution</A> as follows:

<UL>

<LI> The weights <b>w[i]</b> are drawn uniformly from <b>[0,1]</b> (and renormalized so that they sum up to 1),

<LI> The means <b>mu[i]</b> are also sampled from a uniform distribution in <b>[0,1]</b>,

<LI> The variance-covariance matrix <b>Sigma[i]</b> (positive definite matrix) is computed as <b>A A^T</b> where the elements are drawn 
from a normal distribution N(0,1) of unit variance centered at zero. 
The matrix elements are scaled by a factor <b>epsilon</b>. 
A smaller value of <b>epsilon</b> separates more the components of the Gaussians.
