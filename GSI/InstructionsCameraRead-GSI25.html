<h1>Camera ready instructions for GSI'25 accepted proceedings paper</h1>

<p>Please kindly prepare your final camera-ready paper by taking into account 
all the reviews available on 
<A HREF="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/GSI2025">CMT</A> using 
the ***<font color="red">Springer LNCS file format</font>*** (<A HREF="https://franknielsen.github.io/GSI/LaTeX2eProceedingsTemplatesdownload.zip">LaTeX style file</A>)
 </p>

<p.
For the camera-ready paper, you are allowed up to
***<font color="red">10 pages</font>***:

That is, you may optionally use two extra pages since the 8-page submission.
However, do not add new results but rather use potentially these two extra pages to refine your explanations or enhance the style of your paper like for example using more centered math equations \[\] instead of inline equations $...$, addressing reviewers' comments, etc.
</p>
 
<p>
Please submit your final camera ready paper on <A HREF="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/GSI2025">CMT</A>
