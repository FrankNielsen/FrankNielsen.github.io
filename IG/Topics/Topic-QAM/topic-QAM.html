Provide a distance between QAMs by considering equivalence classes of QAM generators, yields a metric space (Theorem 1).
Distance is maximum of QAM absolute difference wrt to x inside hyperrectangle and weight in standard simplex.

We can approximate m_h by m_poly such that distance is less or equal than eps by a polynomial with rational coefficients generator
