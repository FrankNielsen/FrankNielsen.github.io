 <h1>Geometry of the family of extended Gaussian distributions</h1>
 by Jacek Karwowski  and Frank Nielsen
  
<h1>Extended Gaussian distributions</h1>
A Gaussian distribution with potential rank-deficient degenerate covariance or precision matrix is called an extended Gaussian distribution.
When the covariance matrix is rank-deficient, we may handle the extended Gaussian distribution as a lower-dimensional non-degenerate Gaussian distribution.
When the precision matrix is degenerate, the degenerate precision matrix Gaussian models an affine subspace.
When this affine subspace is of dimension 0, we get a Dirac distribution.
Degenerate precision Gaussians were first studied by James [James, 1973] are used to model non-determinism in Willems's framework 
of open stochastic systems [Willems, 2012].
We consider below zero-centered extended Gaussian distributions.

<h1>Parameter space</h1>
The parameter space of (zero-centered) extended Gaussian distributions form a bicone:

For 2x2 matrices, we can visualize the bicone in R3:<BR

<h1>Hilbert geometry</h2>
Because the bicone is bounded convex object, we may consider its underlying Hilbert geometry.
We get the following Hilbert distance:<BR>

<h1>Nested Hilbert geometry</h1>
Hilbert distance is defined on a bounded open convex domain.
We can enlarge the bicone by scaling by a factor 1+eps so that it contains the bicone parameter space, and thus defines a proper (finite) 
distance  between degenerate Gaussians.<BR>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by degenerate covariance or
degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, i.e. two partial
symmetric positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we study the
Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric positive-definite bicone. We report
the closed-form formula for the corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively
its invariance properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for dealing
with extended Gaussian distributions.
