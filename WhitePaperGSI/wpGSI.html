with header "[GSI white paper]"
<p>
In this paper, we would like to give an overview of the cross-disciplinary field of GSI 
that is reflected by the various sessions at GSI conferences. 
The aim is to broaden the interest of researchers and to concisely introduce them to the main themes, 
challenges, and results and open problems of GSI.<BR>
Each "topic/theme" should be summarized in 1-3 pages (excluding references). See below for some examples.
<BR>
In a second stage, people are welcome to give comments and we shall address the synergy of those topics, and smoothen/broaden the text for researchers entering the field.
