Abstract:

In this talk, we first present the dualistic structures of information geometry on the manifold of
symmetric positive-definite matrices [1,2], and discuss some algorithmic aspects [1,2,3].
We then study the Hilbert geometry induced by some bounded convex matrix spaces with applications: the elliptope of correlations matrices [4], and the Siegel disk domain [5].
