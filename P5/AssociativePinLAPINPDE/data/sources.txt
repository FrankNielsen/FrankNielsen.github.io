Zoom-eyed Creatures

If you ever get a feeling of being followed, this is quite normal. Do not worry, it’s not paranoia. You are being followed by a team of picked zoom-eyed creatures. They have popped their eyes and are full of attention.
Turbodesigner Olesia Kozlova have drawn a set of icons with the nicest goggle-eyed creatures – champions of staring contests. 
You are free to do whatever you want with them but be careful not to let them subdue your mind. 
Take this hypnotoad to start with.
