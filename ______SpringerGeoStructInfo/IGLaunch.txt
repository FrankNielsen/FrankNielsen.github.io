Dear Shinto and Nihat,

IG journal inaugural issue is scheduled next year, and I propose that we (EIC+Co-Ed) also contribute for
this first issue on a concise article/essay 
on the historical developments of information geometry (milestones), its challenges and future directions.
We may ask our honorary editors (Prof Amari and Csiszar) to proofread it.

I mentioned this project to Jun who is backing up positively this proposal.

What do you think?

Best regards.
