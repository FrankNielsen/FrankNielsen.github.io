[Geometric Structures of Information] Call for book chapter

Dear Colleague,

We are currently working on editing a peer-reviewed Springer book focusing on "Geometric Structures of Information."
The book shall be published in November 2018 by Springer in the same collection as "Matrix Information Geometry", see 
http://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783642302312

We already received a dozen nice proposals.
I became familiar with your work and would like to sollicitate for your contribution.

Therefore I kindly invite you to submit a chapter on either your original contribution or on a survey 
(in the latter case, please state survey) with the following deadlines:

Important dates:
- 31st January: Title proposal 
	(eventually with a short abstract, estimated page length, so that we can organize the overall structure of the book)

- March 1st 2018: Submission due
- 15th June 2018: Review feedback
- 15th September 2018: Revised draft due
- 15th October 2018: Acceptance notification
- 15th November 2018: Camera-ready files due
- March 1st 2019: Edited book published by Springer.

We are looking forward to receiving your contribution.

Best regards, Frank Nielsen.
