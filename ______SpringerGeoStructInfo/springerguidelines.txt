The manuscript due date is November 30, 2018 . Assembly of a contributed volume can be a time-consuming process, so it is best to set an earlier deadline for contributors, to allow time to review and finalize all submissions. Please pass on this message (including the Table of Contents, the attached Consent-to-publish and Permission Request forms and the link to Book Manuscript Guidelines) to your contributing authors. Please note that ‘‘Signals and Communication Technology” follows the Reference Style MathPhysSci , Citation Style  Numbered and Numbering Style ChapterContent.

 

We strongly recommend that all chapter authors (corresponding authors, co-authors, contributing authors) include their affiliation and email address in their manuscript. Their email addresses (also published in the chapters) will be used by Springer to provide authors with a personal MySpringer account where they can download a free copy of the eBook. In addition, all authors will be offered a 40% discount on any eBook or print book order from our web shop. Both the free eBook and the author discount will be activated on MySpringer.

 

We would appreciate it very much if you could impress upon your authors that they should obtain permissions from the previous publisher for any material they want to reuse.

I look forward to working with you, and hope you will not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
