I enjoyed reading the paper although I recommend the Author added some figures and label all equations. 
How to define reference duality in this context?
I recommend to accept this chapter.

In Sec 1 "a concluding remark" (remove s)
Is simplex open or not?
Define star notation in (1)
In Sec 2 after [5] remove , in (,
In assumption 2, define subscript vs superscript notation
In assump. 3 (sign definite = non-zero ?)
before (6), why is it called "geometric divergence" explain meaning of geometric here (immersion?)
In Eq 7, typo ?
After Eq 9, you can also mention the conformal divergence:

Page 6, explain "projectively flat"
label examples ex1 ex2 in Sec 2.4

Page 8, one-to-one functional. See
Nielsen, Frank, and Richard Nock. "On R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies and divergences for exponential families." arXiv preprint arXiv:1105.3259 (2011).


Page 9, upper envelope (add a e)

It is very nice to have the appendix.

For beginners, please explain eq 19: right quantity seems scalar and left vector field
How R depends on $\nabla$?

P14: define pregeodesic
meaning of $*$ in A.2 ?
