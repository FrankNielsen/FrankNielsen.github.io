Montrucchio and Pistone,
A class of non-parametric deformed exponential statistical models

The paper contains interesting extensions of the work published in [14].

I have one suggestion for improvement.
The remark about the work of Donsker and Varadhan on page 12 is rather puzzling,
particularly because the discussion continues with the two possible
choices of fixing the non-uniqueness of the function K_p(u).
I guess it would be better to start a new section after (12)
and to put Donsker and Varadhan there.

Small remarks

l.3 of Sect. 1: the symbol 'cal.P' is not yet defined. Anyhow, 'at each p' is confusing.
Therefore it is better to replace 'at each p in {\cal P}' by 'at p'.

p2, l14: 'dominate' should read 'dominated'

p2, l16: 'in a special case on Sec. 2' better ' the use of 'on' is not appropriate, better is 'in Section 2'

l4 of Sect. 2: the integral contains twice the differential 'd\xi'

Line before (4): A(x)<1 holds in Nigel Newton's case, not in general. hence, the lhs of (4) should contain 1/||A||.

l1 of 2.1 contains "the the"

p4 l9: "with parameter 1/2 of [17]," looks silly. Better is "of [17], with parameter 1/2,"

Sect. 3.1, line 3: the use of the infinity norm of q, although not incorrect, is confusing because it gives the impression that q should be bounded. The third item in the series of inequalities may be omitted.

Prop. 3, item 2): it is not clear what is meant by a 'simple density'. Is it linked to absence of ideals?

p.11, last but 1 line: It is not clear what you mean by 'quasi-integrable'.

p. 12, l3 from below: It is not clear why the choice of u such that its mean w.r.t. the escort of q vanishes is relevant for Statistical Physics.
I am pretty sure that Landau and Lifschitz never heard about escort distributions.
Can you explain why this choice is of special interest in Statistical Physics?

p13, l4: 'representation' should read 'representations'
