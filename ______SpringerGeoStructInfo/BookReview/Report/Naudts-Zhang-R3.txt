I strongly recommend to accept this paper.


- Is faithful in Theo 1 a usual term (add ref then)
- In Eq 7, index S by rho tau?
- why index proba density with superscript theta instead of usual subscript? add footnote?
- page 6, a table with the rho, tau, f, f^* would be nice with various examples
- Sec 5 "by taking two derivatives" "by taking its second-order partial derivatives"?
- Sec 7 specify that you use regular exp fam

I also recommend to add those citations:
