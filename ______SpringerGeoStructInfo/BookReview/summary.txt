We list the following twelve contributed chapters that have been peer-reviewed and revised:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Naudts and Zhang present in their paper entitled ``Rho-Tau Embedding of Statistical Models'' 
the $(\rho,\tau)$ embedding of statistical models (for any two increasing functions $\rho$ and $\tau$) 
and discuss about the gauge freedom and the induced geometry.

\item Montrucchio and Pistone studied a class of non-parametric deformed statistical models, its associated statistical divergence and the
induced geometry in their paper ``A Class of Non-parametric Deformed Exponential
Statistical Models.''

\item Henmi and Matsuzoe survey and report recent results on statistical manifolds admitting torsion (SMAT) and precontrast functions,
and show how to get this SMAT structure from an estimating function in their paper entitled ``Statistical Manifolds Admitting Torsion and
Partially Flat Spaces.''

\item Ohara studies the transformation on the probability simplex from a viewpoint of affine differential geometry 
and provides some applications in his paper ``Conformal flattening on the probability simplex and its applications to Voronoi partitions and centroids.''

\item Nielsen and Hadjeres introduce a sequence of computationally-friendly information-geometric dualistic manifolds approximating a computationally-untractable statistical manifold in their paper 
``Monte Carlo Information-Geometric Structures.''

\item Wong in his paper ``Information geometry in portfolio theory'' applies the
principle of information geometry to financial problems.

\item Maroufy and Marriott describe the use of information geometry for Cox regression in survival analysis in their paper entitled ``Generalising Frailty Assumptions in Survival
Analysis: a Geometric Approach.''

\item Broniatowski and Stummer present a unifying view of dissimilarities in their detailed paper
``Some Universal Insights on Divergences for Statistics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.''

\item Chirikjian studies information theory in interaction with Lie Groups in his paper called
  ``Information-Theoretic Matrix Inequalities and Diffusion Processes on Unimodular Lie Groups.''

\item Said, Bombrun and Berthoumieu proved that the Rao-Fisher
information metric of any location-scale model is a warped Riemannian metric provided that the model is invariant
under the action of some Lie group  in their paper ``Warped Riemannian metrics for location-scale models.''

\item Nielsen and Sun propose to use the Hilbert geometry for modeling the probability simplex and the elliptope of correlation matrices in their paper entitled ``Clustering in Hilbert Geometry
Two case studies: The Probability Simplex and
the Correlation Elliptope.''

\item Finally, Barbaresco presents an introduction on Koszul's pionneering work on homogeneous bounded domains 
that has revealed itself as the elementary structures of information geometry in his paper 
``Jean-Louis Koszul and the elementary structures of Information Geometry.''

I wish to express my sincere appreciation to our referees listed in alphabetical order:


Last but not least, I would like to thank Professor Hiroaki Kitano (President of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc) 
for his kind support and encouragements.
