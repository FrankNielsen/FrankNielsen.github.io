===LAUNCH INSTRUCTIONS===

In the command line:
$ java -jar <filename>.jar

For all Jars except demo.jar, this will launch an animation demonstrating a property of hilbert balls.

For demo.jar this will launch an applet with a range of buttons on the top row. From left to right:
# "Change to mode:UNIT_BALL/DRAW_CONTOUR": allows the user to switch between "UNIT_BALL" mode to define the center of hilbert balls, and "DRAW_CONTOUR" mode to edit the hilbert convex domain.
# "Change to mode: RED/GREY/NORMAL" : in UNIT_BALL mode, changes the color of the selected Hilbert ball - useful for visualization.
# "Reinitialize": In UNIT_BALL mode, erases all center points. In DRAW_CONTOUR: reinitializes the Hilbert domain and the center points.
# "+" / "-": In UNIT_BALL mode: allows the user to change the radius of the selected Hilbert ball. (step is 0.1).
# "Activate rays": In UNIT_BALL mode, allows the user to visualise the rays for the selected Hilbert ball.

# In DRAW_CONTOUR mode:
The user can define the Hilbert domain by:
-left clicking on the screen to add a vertex to the domain - the domain traced will be the convex hull of all points.
-left clicking on an existing vertex and dragging it to another location.

#In UNIT_BALL mode:
The user can define a Hilbert ball by:
-left clicking inside the domain to define a center point - by default the radius is 1.0.
-left clicking on an existing center point and dragging it to another location to move it.
-left clicking on an existing center point to select it. A selected center point is displayed in red instead of in black. Information regarding a selected ball will be displayed on screen (coordinates of the center point, number of edges and radius).
-right-clicking on an existing center point to remove it.

Alternatively, demo.jar can take one optional argument:
- [optional] path to an inputfile: that encodes information about a convex and a hilbert balls. If not provided, the user can define everything by hand following the previous instructions.

The input file should be written as follows:

N //number of vertices for the convex
X0 Y0
X1 Y1
.
X(N-1) Y(N-1) //coordinates of the vertices
M //number of center points
X0 Y0 R0
X1 Y1 R1

X(N-1) Y(N-1) R(N-1) //coordinates of the center points and radius of the hilbert ball
