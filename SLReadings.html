On the Hypotheses Which Lie at the Bases of Geometry

Defined flatness and curvature with hyperbolic metric
Riemann also considered possible a quartic form for line element instead of the quadratic form.
"The next case in simplicity includes those manifoldnesses in which the
line-element may be expressed as the fourth root of a quartic differential expression. 
The investigation of this more general kind would require no really
different principles, but would take considerable time and throw little new
light on the theory of space, especially as the results cannot be geometrically
expressed"
