<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Bregman divergences (BDs) play a prominent role in information sciences and engineering. 
In this talk, we will introduce some recent extensions and generalizations of BDs with applications: 
First, we extend the BDs to two comparable generators to define duo Bregman pseudo-divergences
 and show applications on truncated exponential families including the truncated normal family [1]. 
 Second, we show how to reconstruct statistical divergences from integral-based Bregman generators. 
 Notably, by selecting the partition function rather than the cumulant function of an exponential family, 
 we recover the extended Kullback-Leibler divergence on unnormalized densities [2]. 
 Third, by constraining the parameter space of BDs to submanifolds, we discuss some properties of curved BDs and
 Hessian submanifolds [3]. 
 Fourth, we show that the generalized Legendre transforms of Artstein-Avidan--Milman axiomatized 
 as inverse-ordering invertible transforms find root in the dual coordinatization of dual Hessian structures
 of information geometry [4].
 Finally, we conclude with the concept of maximal invariants which provides a valuable perspective
 for analyzing and understanding the structural forms of statistical divergences [5].
