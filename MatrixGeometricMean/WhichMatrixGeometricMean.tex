The geometric mean between two positive reals $x$ and $y$ is $G(x,y)=\sqrt{xy}$.
To define the geometric mean between two positive-definite matrices $X$ and $Y$, we may generalize different properties of the scalar geometric mean as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The geometric mean is the limit of power means for $p\rightarrow 0$.
	Since power means are quasi-arithmetic means for , get the following geometric matrix mean
	
	\item The geometric mean is the centroid with respect to the distance $\rho(x,y)=\left\| \log\frac{x}{y}\right|$
	
	\item The geometric mean is the limit of the inductive AHM mean
	
\end{itemize}
