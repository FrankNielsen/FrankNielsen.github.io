Hi,

I've attached a pdf of the certificate of award.  Unfortunately, it does
not contain Karl Tombre's signature as he signed the certificates at the
conference prior to them being framed.  The framed copy will have his
signature and will be mailed to you.

Happy Holidays,
Paula

Dear Colleague,

Thank you so much for your prompt response. May we suggest the
following two steps to send us the
certificate:

-could you scan and email us an electronic copy of the award, to both
of us, at rnock@martinique.univ-ag.fr,
nielsen@lix.polytechnique.fr . This will ensure (i) that both of us
get a copy (if, perhaps, there is only
one paper copy), and (ii) in the possible event that the paper award
gets lost during its postal mail,
we will still have a proof of obtention --- this is too important a
matter to face this possibility.

-could send us the paper certificate at:

Richard Nock
Universite des Antilles et de la Guyane
CEREGMIA - UFR Droit et Sciences Economiques
Campus de Schoelcher
BP 7209
97275 Schoelcher Cedex, Martinique (France)

Once again, thanks *a lot* for your help,

Best Regards,

-Richard.
