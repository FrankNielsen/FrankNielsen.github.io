Bregman divergence is the remainder of a first-order Taylor polynomial induced by a generator $F(x)$.
Thus there are as many expressions of Bregman divergences as there are remainder expressions of Taylor expansions.


Integral form of Bregman divergence

$$
B_F(p:q)=\int_q^p (p-t)F''(t)\dt
$$

For example, let $F(x)=x\log x$, $F''(x)=\frac{1}{x}$, then

$$
B_F(p:q)=\int_q^p (p-t)/t\dt = p\int_q^p\frac{1}{t}\dt -\int_q^p \dt
= p\log\frac{p}{q}+q-p
$$

From the fundamental theorem of calculus
$F(x)=F(a)+\int_a^x F'(t)\dt$, we deduce that


$$
B_F=\int_a^x 
$$
